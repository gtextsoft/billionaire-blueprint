          Success isn't just about making money. <br/>

            I've sat in rooms with world leaders. I've gained access to high-level information. 
            I've walked into powerful spaces.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Yet, every time, one painful question haunts me:
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-navy italic">
            "Where are the faces of my generation?"
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-navy italic">
            "Where are the ones coming behind?"
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I worryâ€¦
          </p>
          
          <p>
            What happens when a generation passes? What happens to the wealth of insights and opportunities uncovered? 
            Will the next generation be forced to start from scratch?
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-navy">
            This is why I do what I do. This is why I teach.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Because success shouldn't be reserved for a privileged few.
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-gold-dark text-xl">
            If knowledge is the key, then I'm giving you the master key.
          </p>
        </div>
